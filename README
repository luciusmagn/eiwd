iwd without dbus 
----------------

This is a complete rewrite of the original eiwd with
the new focus being to modify as little as possible
from upstream.

All that has changed in the iwd code is the insertion
of ifdefs to block away dbus code when desired.


CHANGES

- ell is included in this repository as a submodule.
- dbus has been made optional in the iwd daemon via
  --disable-dbus.
- Fixed non-posix ln usage in Makefile.
- Added a simple script to generate iwd configuration
  files called iwd_passphrase (similar to wpa_passphrase).


BUILDING WITHOUT DBUS

    ./configure \
        --prefix=/usr \
        --localstatedir=/var \
        --disable-dbus

    make
    make DESTDIR="BLA BLA" install


WHAT FUNCTIONALITY IS LOST?

The only working utlities are iwd and iwmon. iwd is
fully functional via its configuration files.

A new client will be written at some stage to allow
finer control over what is available via the iwd
configuration files.

Think of eiwd's iwd daemon usage as wpa_supplicant
without the use of wpa_cli. Just a daemon which is
configured via config files (set and forget).


FUTURE

- [ ] Add a non-dbus client.
- [x] Pre-generate manual pages for dist tarballs.

Wireless daemon for Linux
*************************

STATUS (GUTTED AND SOMEWHAT HACKY)

* Daemon works without DBUS.
* Simple client implemented (iwc).
* Simple tool added (iwd_passphrase).

GOALS

* Implement our own full client in C using a different IPC.
* Bring 'wired/' back into tree and get it to function without DBUS.


BUILDING

    ./configure \
        --prefix=/usr \
        --localstatedir=/var

    make
    make install

    => [au]th [ssid]
        - Add a new network by creating the
        - network configuration file.
        - Afterwards run [iwc] [conn] [ssid]
        - to connect to the network.

    => [co]nnect [ssid]
        - Connect to an SSID.
        - Reconnect to SSID.

    => [de]lete [ssid]
        - Delete a network's conf file.

    => [di]sconnect [ssid]
        - Disconnect from SSID.

    => [li]st
        - List all configured networks.

    => [sc]an
        - Show scan results.
        - These results are updated by the
        - [iwd] daemon periodically.

    => [ss]id
        - Show connected network SSID.

SSID NAMING

See: IWD.NETWORK(5) (man iwd.network).

		By default the Wireless client binary iwctl is enabled
		and place into --bindir directory.

	--disable-monitor

		Disable installation of Wireless monitor utility

		By default the Wireless monitor binary iwmon is enabled
		and place into --bindir directory.

	--disable-dbus-policy

		Disable installation of D-Bus system policy configuration

		By default the accompanying D-Bus policy file will be
		installed in the D-Bus data directory. The location of
		that directory will be automatically detected or can be
		manually configured via the --with-dbus-datadir option.

		The D-Bus policy is required for daemons to gain service
		name ownership and clients to access them. When disabling
		this option, manual installation of D-Bus polices is
		required.

		Note: This option affects all D-Bus policy configurations.

	--disable-systemd-service

		Disable installation of systemd service configuration

		By default the accompanying systemd service unit with
		D-Bus autostart configuration will be installed. The
		locations will be automatically detected or can be
		manually configured via --with-dbus-busdir option
		and --with-systemd-unitdir option.

		Using systemd is optional, but highly recommended. When
		disabling this option, manual installation is required.

		Note: This option affects all systemd unit setups.

	--disable-manual-pages

		Disable generation and installation of manual pages

		By default all available manual pages will be generated
		and installed. When disabling this options, no manual
		pages are installed.

		Note: This options affects all manual pages.

When building for a system that wants to use wireless technology, disabling
any of the above options makes only limited sense. It may break the general
setup and usability for wireless connections.

The configuration system provides switches for optional build time features
that can be enabled if the functionality is required:

	--enable-external-ell

		Enable usage of external Embedded Linux library

		This allows using an externally installed Embedded Linux
		library instead of using the internal copy of ELL.

		Since the public API of Embedded Linux library is not yet
		stable, the usage of the internal ELL copy is preferred.

	--enable-wired

		Enable installation of Ethernet authentication daemon

		This allows enabling the Ethernet daemon binary ead which
		is then placed into --libexecdir directory.

		With this option the support for 802.1x for wired Ethernet
		connections can be enabled. It provides its own D-Bus
		policy and systemd configuration.

	--enable-hwsim

		Enable installation of Wireless simulation utility

		This allows enabling the Simulation daemon binary hwsim
		which is then placed into --bindir directory.

		With this utility and mac80211_hwim kernel module the
		simulation of 802.11 networks can be tested. It provides
		its own D-Bus policy configuration.

		This utility is only useful for developers and should not
		be considered for general installation. For this reason
		no systemd configuration is provided.

	--enable-tools

		Enable compilation of various testing utilities

		This enables building of all utilities that are however
		not installed and only useful during development.

	--enable-ofono

		Enable support for oFono SIM authentication

		Note: With --disable-daemon this option is ignored

	--enable-sim-hardcoded

		Enable support for hard coded SIM keys

		Note: With --disable-daemon this option is ignored


Netlink monitoring
==================

The included iwmon utility can be used to monitor the 802.11 subsystem
generic netlink commands and events. It uses the nlmon kernel driver
from Linux 3.10 and later. On startup network monitor interface named
named 'nlmon' is created unless another interface name is given on the
command line. If the monitor interface was created by the iwmon utility,
it will be removed on program exit.

Manually the monitor interface can be created using the following
commands:

	ip link add name nlmon type nlmon
	ip link set dev nlmon allmulticast on
	ip link set dev nlmon up

It is possible to create netlink traces in PCAP format using tcpdump
and then read them via iwmon utility:

	tcpdump -i nlmon -w trace-file.pcap

The resulting PCAP files will use Linux cooked packet format containing
packets with ARPHRD_NETLINK type. They can be read using iwmon:

	iwmon -r trace-file.pcap

At this time iwmon is not able to write PCAP files by itself. This might
change in future versions.

When also the authentication protocol traffic on port 0x888e (ETH_P_PAE)
is needed, then a second capture is required:

	tcpdump -i any 'ether proto 0x888e' -w trace-pae.pcap

It is possible to combine these two PCAP files using the mergecap utility
and create a combined trace file:

	mergecap -F pcap -w trace.pcap trace-file.pcap trace-pae.pcap

This will create a trace.pcap file that includes the complete picture
of nl80211 netlink traffic and authentication messages. All packets are
merged in chronological order based on timestamps.

Unfortunately it is not possible to instruct tcpdump filtering to do
this in a single capture. Post-processing of the PCAP files is required
at the moment.


Simulating devices
==================

The Linux driver mac80211_hwsim provides the functionality to simulate
Wireless devices using fake virtual air. Just load the module.

	modprobe mac80211_hwsim radios=0

Providing the radios=0 is important since otherwise it starts out with
two new Wireless radios by default.

With the provided hwsim utility it is now possible to add and remove
virtual radio devices.

	hwsim --create --keep
	hwsim --destroy=<radio-id>

The radio id assigned to each virtual device is its internal id used
by the Wireless device.
