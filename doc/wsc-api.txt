Object path	/net/connman/iwd/{phy0,phy1,...}/p2p_peers/{aa_bb_cc_dd_ee_ff}

Methods		void PushButton()

			Start WSC (formerly known as WPS, Wi-Fi Protected
			Setup) configuration in PushButton mode or trigger a
			connection to a specific P2P peer.  The usage will
			depend on which object this interface is found on.

			In the first use case any connected networks on the
			device will be disconnected and scanning will commence
			to find the access point in PushButton mode.  If
			multiple access points are found, then a
			SessionOverlap error will be returned.

			This method returns once the configuration has been
			completed and the network or the P2P peer has been
			successfully connected.

			Possible errors:
			net.connman.iwd.SimpleConfiguration.SessionOverlap
			net.connman.iwd.SimpleConfiguration.NoCredentials
			net.connman.iwd.SimpleConfiguration.WalkTimerExpired
			net.connman.iwd.SimpleConfiguration.NotReachable
			net.connman.iwd.Aborted
			net.connman.iwd.Failed
			net.connman.iwd.Busy
			net.connman.iwd.InvalidArguments
			net.connman.iwd.NotSupported

		string GeneratePin()

			Generates a random 8 digit PIN with an included check
			digit suitable for use by most user interfaces.

		void StartPin(string pin)

			Start WSC or connect to a specific P2P peer in PIN
			mode.  If iwd's WSC configuration indicates that the
			device does not support a display, a static PIN from
			the main.conf configuration file is used.  Contents
			of pin are ignored in this case.

			Otherwise, the pin provided will be utilized.  This
			can be an automatically generated PIN that contains a
			check digit, or a user-specified PIN.  The
			GeneratePin() method can be used a generate a random
			8 digit PIN with an included check digit.

			This method returns once the configuration has been
			completed and the network or the P2P peer has been
			successfully connected.

			Possible errors:
			net.connman.iwd.SimpleConfiguration.NoCredentials
			net.connman.iwd.SimpleConfiguration.NotReachable
			net.connman.iwd.SimpleConfiguration.WalkTimerExpired
			net.connman.iwd.Aborted
			net.connman.iwd.Failed
			net.connman.iwd.Busy
			net.connman.iwd.InvalidArguments
			net.connman.iwd.InvalidFormat
			net.connman.iwd.NotSupported

		void Cancel()

			Aborts any ongoing WSC operations or a P2P connection.
			If no operation is ongoing, net.connman.iwd.NotAvailable
			is returned.
