P2P hierarchy
=============

Service		net.connman.iwd
Interface	net.connman.iwd.p2p.Device [Experimental]
Object path	/net/connman/iwd/{phy0,phy1,...}

Methods		array(on) GetPeers()

			Returns a list (possibly empty) of detected P2P peers.
			Each record returned contains a tuple of the following
			values.

			object Object

				The net.connman.iwd.p2p.Peer object
				representing the peer device.

			int16 SignalStrength

				Peer's signal strength expressed in 100 * dBm.
				The value is the range of 0 (strongest signal)
				to -10000 (weakest signal.)

		void RequestDiscovery()

			Starts device discovery if not already happening and
			registers the calling D-Bus client as requiring device
			discovery.  The discovery phase will be active until
			all registered clients have called ReleaseDiscovery()
			or disconnected from D-Bus.

			Possible errors: [service].Error.AlreadyExists

		void ReleaseDiscovery()

			Unregisters the calling client as requiring device
			discovery.  Clients should do this as soon as they
			stop displaying or otherwise using the list of
			discovered peer devices to avoid keeping the Wi-Fi
			adapter occupied unnecessarily.

			Possible errors: [service].Error.NotAvailable

		void RegisterSignalLevelAgent(object path,
						 array(int16) levels)

			Register the agent object to receive signal strength
			level change notifications on the
			net.connman.iwd.Station.SignalLevelAgent interface,
			see station-api.txt.  The "levels" parameter decides
			the thresholds in dBm that will generate a call to
			the agent's Changed method whenever current RSSI
			crosses any of the values.  The values must be
			passed in descending order.  The number and distance
			between requested threshold values is a compromise
			between resolution and the frequency of system
			wakeups and context-switches that are going to be
			occuring to update the client's signal meter.  Only
			one agent can be registered at any time.

			Possible errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.Failed
					 [service].Error.AlreadyExists
					 [service].Error.NotSupported

		void UnregisterSignalLevelAgent(object path)

			Unregister an existing agent.

			Possible errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.NotFound

Properties	boolean Enabled [readwrite]

			Whether local P2P device is started and ready to
			start device discovery, become discoverable by peers
			and connect to peers.

		string Name [readwrite]

			Sets local P2P device name as it is going to be
			presented on other devices that we will connect to
			or ones that discover us in scanning.

		uint16 AvailableConnections [readonly]

			Minimum number of peers the hardware is capable of
			connecting to in the current configuration and in
			addition to any connections already established.
			Often 1 while idle and 0 if connected to a peer,
			connecting, disconnecting or otherwise busy.

			A non-zero number is to be interpreted as meaning
			that the device is capable of making *at least*
			that many new connections as the final number may
			depend on parameters negotiated with future peers.
